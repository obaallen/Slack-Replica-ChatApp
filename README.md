By far the most interesting project so far. For this project, I tried as much as possible to meet all requirements and add two extra features.

The project consists of 2 html files, one javascript file and the application.py server file.
I went extra on the styling as I see this as a project I can continue to work on.

On first visit, the user is prompted for a display name with a modal that cannot be removed unless filled correctly. Users then land in the default channel. They can either chat there or create other channels to chat in. The user also has the opportunity to logout of the chat app.

If the user has visited earlier, the last visited channel should load, showing all previous messages, plus messages the user might have missed while away.
I used local storage to store the user's display name and last visited channel, in order to help the user land in the last channel visited.

For extra features, I added the delete button, to allow users delete posts. I also added the functionality to chat privately. The private feature is currently basic, but it will be something I will continue to improve on as a personal project.
